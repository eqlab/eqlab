This is tested primarily on Linux Mint 17.1. I don't know if the data
processing parts of this project will run on non-Linux distributions,
but you're welcome to try. I'll update these instructions if someone
gets it working.

== Setting up the environment ==

If you're on Windows:
	Install cygwin. You don't need this if you know what
	you're doing, but the instructions here will assume
	you have a unix terminal.

If you want the always-updated code from the btsync folder:
	Install git from your preferred repository or from:
		http://www.git-scm.com/
	Download btsync from:
		https://www.getsync.com/

If you want to run data processing code ("processors" folder)
	Install theano using instructions on:
		http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html


== Getting the code ==

1. Create a directory where the code will be stored. Copy the btsync 
executable to that directory and run it. If you're on Linux, open a
new tab to:
	http://localhost:8888.

3. Enter the key: BHVVONNZJWV6BK7PA5IG42MB424XREIOL. Once that's done 
syncing, you'll have a folder called 'global-read-only'.

4. Open a terminal (cygwin on Windows) and navigate to the directory 
that contains the global-read-only folder. (Don't go into the
global-read-only folder.) Run the following in a terminal:
	git clone global-read-only local

The project will now be in the folder "local".

As long as btsync is running, it should keep the global-read-only
folder up-to-date. If you want to pull changes into your "local"
directory, run the following in a terminal while in the "local"
directory:
	git pull --rebase
