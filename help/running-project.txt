== Running scrapers ==

1. If you have someone else's data files and want to save
time, copy them to the data/ directory in your "local"
folder:
	cd local
	mkdir data
	cp saved_data_file data/

2. All available scrapers will be in the scrapers/ folder.
You can execute them through x:
	chmod +x ./x
	./x scrapers/fimfic_story_api.py
	./x scrapers/mootchan_mlp_thread.py

3. The results will be in the data/ directory in your "local"
folder. The fimfic_story_api.py and mootchan_mlp_thread.py
scripts store the data in sqlite3 databases:	
	sqlite3 data/fimfic_story_api.sqlite3
	sqlite3 data/mootchan_mlp_thread.sqlite3
